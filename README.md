This is an stm32 kicad library based on the stm32cube database.

To regenerate the library, you will need to get the stm32cube database submodule by running the following commands:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

The generate.sh script does that for you.

添加方法
Open Kicad 原理图，选择设置->符号库管理->将现有库添加到表中
